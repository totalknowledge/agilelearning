# Agile Learning

Agile Learning is a project to help people learn coding, the agile methodology and getting started on their first projects.  While some background in programming will be beneficial this project assumes no prior knowledge.  If you reach a tutorial or learning story then simply mark as done and continue.  

In our own experience one of the hardest parts of learning programming is understanding the set up and project tasks that are sometimes glossed over or not covered at all.  Much of the early learning will focus on getting your environment ready to work on your first project.

This learning project focuses on a specific set of technologies that are relatively common in todays market.  While the tools and languages covered here may not be what you ultimately use, they are a good foundation.  If you wish to depart from or use different technologies we will try and point out where it might be easy to do so.

The first technology and environment we will cover is git, GitHub, and some of the related technologies since we are hosted there, and its presumed you will store your first project here as well.

## Lesson 1 - Getting your computer ready.

Since presumably you will want to make changes to your project, the first task will be to clone this repository.  If you have not already done so it is necessary to create a GitHub account.  The page to register a new account is simply the [GitHub home page](https://github.com/ "GitHub").
